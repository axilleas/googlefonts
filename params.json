{"name":"Googlefonts","tagline":"Mirror of Google Web Fonts that contains only the relevant *.ttf files.","body":"This is mirror of [Google Web\r\nFonts](http://code.google.com/p/googlefontdirectory/) that contains only the\r\nrelevant *.ttf files that end users need to use the fonts.\r\n\r\n## About \r\n\r\nCreated for easier access to all of Google's Web Fonts, with a smaller download\r\nsize (~150 MB) compared with using Google's official repository (~2 GB).\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nInstall these fonts the same way as you would with any other font. Copy the \r\ndesired fonts to your system's font directory. Grab all the fonts in a \r\ncompressed format by downloading one of these: \r\n\r\n-   *.zip: https://github.com/axilleas/googlefonts/zipball/master\r\n-   *.tar.gz: https://github.com/axilleas/googlefonts/tarball/master\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nPresently, there is no quick method for users to install all the fonts from \r\nGoogle's official mercurial repository.\r\n\r\nIn order to install from the official method, the general instructions are:\r\n\r\n-  Clone Google's hg repository (~2GB in size)\r\n-  Traverse through a 3-level deep directory structure to find a relevant\r\n    *.ttf file.\r\n\r\n        googlefontdirectory\r\n        |-- apache\r\n        |   |-- aclonica\r\n                |-- Aclonica.ttf\r\n                ...\r\n-  Copy the file to your system's font directory.\r\n-  Repeat the previous steps for each of the ~1000 Google Web Fonts in\r\n    googlefontdirectory.\r\n\r\nWhilst steps 2-4 can be completed in one step (.e.g. using `find` in Linux), \r\nusers are still required to keep the 2GB repository lying around to pull any\r\nupdates and copy the changes over.\r\n\r\nThis repository is created and updated doing exactly that, i.e:\r\n    \r\n    mkdir -p googlefonts/git && cd googlefonts\r\n    hg clone https://code.google.com/p/googlefontdirectory/ hg\r\n    cd hg && hg pull --update && cd ..\r\n    find hg -maxdepth 3 -type f -name \\*.ttf -exec rsync -a {} git \\;\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
